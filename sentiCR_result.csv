444.0,12,2020-08-15T03:13:09.199000,Antoine,Hello Gophers. I have a quick question about goroutines. Basically I need to know how to count them.1) I have an HTTP server written in golang. It uses the Gin framework which in turn uses the Golang standard HTTP library. From what I understand the standard library spawns each new HTTP request in a new goroutine.2) I want to initiate a server shutdown such that:  1. no new HTTP connections can be established  2. the work finishes in all existing HTTP requests  3. the server shuts downI found Atomic Counters in the GoByExample to be exactly what I need:<https://gobyexample.com/atomiccounters>However this example does `wg.Add(1)` before the goroutine is spawned.In my case the goroutine is spawned by the standard library.Do I have to use a different solution? Does someone want to point me in the right direction?,1

I have this method that list all files in a repository similar to git lsfiles. However this makes the request take about 300ms.. Whereas the same request takes about 50ms using Node.js.

You can\'t use a `\\` inside the `{}` in an fstring so you can\'t do things like `f""Some random text {\'\\'.join(list_of_things)}""` There are ways to get around this but they are cumbersome and just using `.format()` is a lot cleaner3. If you need to reuse a string with different values you have to have a literal string in every location which is a pain to refactor. With `.format()` you can reuse the base string as many times as you want.```pystring = Key: {} Val: {}""print(string.format(""test 4))print(string.format(""Foo 5))```",0

I recognize their advantages and what not but (and this is a big but) they don\'t seem idiomatic Go to me. It feels like something\'s not right when writing Go code that adheres to one of these C#/Java types of architectures. Am I wrong about this?

If it\'s a novel interface (in that existing types aren\'t likely to implement it) you probably won\'t get much use out of it without declaring your own type but it\'s most definitely possible to declare an interface for some functionality that you need that existing (standard library or thirdparty packages) types already implement.,0

I see this ```Using //export in a file places a restriction on the preamble: since it is copied into two different C output files it must not contain any definitions only declarations. If a file contains both definitions and declarations then the two output files will produce duplicate symbols and the linker will fail. To avoid this definitions must be placed in preambles in other files or in C source files.```in the documentation but to be honest the explanation has me completely lost. is anyone able to help out? thank you.,2

1648.0,23,2020-09-21T19:22:38.263000,Modi,Hey folks. I have an internal battle with respect to where interfaces should live.There's a belief in the Go community that methods/functions should define the interfaces they want which sounds sane. However in practice I don't really see how that works particularly if things share interfaces. I don't want to define the interface repeatedly in various packages for hopefully obvious reasons but I do want to do the idiomatic Go thing provided it makes sense.The specific code I'm working with right now is a cross cutting concern: logging. I have a set of services that all adhere to the same logging interface because we're standardizing our services around a logging abstraction we've written. It seems sensible to reuse the same interface isolated to it's own package somewhere.What are your thoughts toward in practice defining interfaces at the site they're used? How would you handle the logging concern specifically if you want to DI a logger into your instances?,1

1796.0,5,2020-09-26T12:53:15.912000,Larsa,Hi guys i\'m doing a sudoku solver program. my function in order to find an element in my slice of ints doesn\'t work like I would like. in fact it finds if in this slice there is the exact numbers at a position. for instance https://prnt.sc/uo9vn9 and in my code I did https://prnt.sc/uo9vt5. I would like that it prints true if only one number is find so if I search 9 it\'ll tells me true because nine is in position 0 of the slice.,1

My intention was to create memory in C (`valuesPointer`) and put that pointer in the C struct `rtn`. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy way to assign values to `valuesPointer` so I tried the solution of making a Go slice but I believe that's triggering garbage collection. I can share the full Go code as well as the Python code if it would help,1

1907.0,1,2020-09-30T12:55:04.954000,Dalett,"Hi there. I am trying to replicate pythons SimpleHTTPServer behaviour in go. So far my static file serving works very well. Now I am at the part where I want to adapt to the design python uses which is a headline containing the path you are on and then prepending bulletpoints for every folder content by inserting it as list item in an unsorted list. So now I am looking at this template structure```html<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC //W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN""><html> <title>Directory listing for {{.Path}}</title> <body> <h2>Directory listing for {{.Path}}</h2> <hr /> <ul> SOME ITERATION HERE !? </ul> <hr /> </body></html>```I also have a handler which should render the template:```gotype directory struct { Path string Content []string}func handler(w http.ResponseWriter r http.Request) { path := r.URL.Path log.Print(path) t := template.New(""directory"") t _ = t.ParseFiles(""template.html"") d := directory{Path: / Content: nil} t.Execute(w d)}```For now it does that with the Path / and no content to test my handlers render functionality.Now for the question. How do I hook that up with my Listener setup?```go fmt.Printf(""Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port %s\ port) h := http.FileServer(http.Dir(""."")) http.ListenAndServe("":""+port h)```Complete code at: https://pastebin.com/wqYXYab5",1
